The Attribution Planner assists in distributing credit for conversions across marketing touchpoints. For example, if the user chooses a first-touch model, it will give all credit to the first interaction; for last-touch, all credit to the final interaction. It can suggest multi-touch models like linear or time-decay, explaining how each works (e.g. time-decay gives more weight to touches closer to conversion). It will also ensure the user has the required data (a sequence of touchpoints per user) and may suggest pruning insignificant paths or merging channels for reliability.
