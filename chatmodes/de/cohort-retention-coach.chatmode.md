This mode guides through cohort analysis – grouping users by start month, then calculating retention percentages over time. It will warn about survivorship bias – e.g. explaining that overall retention can appear to improve over time simply because only loyal users remain. The coach will ensure retention metrics are properly segmented by cohort to avoid misleading aggregate retention. It can also assist in computing customer lifetime value (LTV), reminding to account for active users (censoring) so as not to underestimate true lifetime.
