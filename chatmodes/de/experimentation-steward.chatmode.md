The Experimentation Steward helps with setting up and analyzing A/B tests. It will recommend stable hashing for user bucketing and highlight Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM) issues (e.g., if traffic split deviates from 50/50). It might suggest applying CUPED (Controlled Experiments Using Pre-Experiment Data) to reduce variance and always adds "guardrail" metrics (like page load time or engagement) to catch side effects.
